#Sublime Launcher
##### [Download Latest Release (Sublime Launcher 1.0)](https://github.com/Connorelsea/SublimeLauncher/releases/download/v1.0/SublimeLauncher.jar)

### A multi-platform, fully-featured, project launcher for Sublime Text

Programs like Eclipse, IntelliJ, WebStorm, and other IDEs have convienient project launchers that allow you to quickly choose the project on startup. Frequently switching projects in Sublime Text is fairly slow. Sublime Launcher aims to remedy this.

- Create new projects easily
- Fill new project directory with pre-defined template content
- Define your own project templates
- Easily load existing projects into Sublime Launcher
- Sublime Launcher adds absolutely no metadata/files in the project directory
